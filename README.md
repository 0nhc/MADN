# MADN
## Meta attention dehazing learning
### Dependencies 
   #### Python3.6
   #### PyTorch>=1.0.1
   #### torchvision
   #### skimage
   #### qtdm
### How to train you model
You can train you model by run the main.py
   
   
   
### Use a pre-trained network for image dehazing:
You can test on the trained model
#### dehaze_80.pth is the pre-trained meta network
#### ｍｏｄｅｌ＿８２.pth is the pre-trained ｄｅｈａｚｉｎｇ network
