# MADN
## Meta attention dehazing learning
### Dependencies 
   　 Python3.6
   　 PyTorch>=1.0.1
   　 torchvision
   　 skimage
   　 tqdm
### How to train you model
You can train you model by run the main.py
   
   
   
### Use a pre-trained network for image dehazing:
You can test on the trained model
 dehaze_80.pth is the pre-trained meta network
 model_82.pth is the pre-trained dehazing network
 %both of the meta network and the dehazing network needed when testing
