![image](https://github.com/TongyJia/MADN/blob/main/dehazed_net.jpg)
### Prerequisites 
   　 Python3.6
     
   　 PyTorch>=1.0.1
     
   　 torchvision>=0.4.2
     
   　 skimage
     
   　 tqdm
   
   
### Use a pre-trained network for image dehazing:
You can test on the trained model:
 dehaze_80.pth is the pre-trained meta network,
 model.pth is the pre-trained dehazing network.
